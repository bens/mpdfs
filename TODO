- Implement layout

- The system seems to hang at certain points
  Hangs with FUTEX_WAIT_PRIVATE

- Error handling needs to be improved
  Factor out code that can handle MPD->fuse conversion

- Refactor, refactor, refactor

- Read/write privileges according to admin level

- Support password protected servers
  Ask for password in fuseInit if necessary?
  Or support ./mpdfs <password> <dir>
  withMPD already handles this, so maybe just let it read the environment.
