About
    A FUSE filesystem for the Music Player Daemon (MPD)

Installing
    First you will need my personal branch of libmpd:

        $ git clone git://github.com/joachifm/libmpd-haskell.git libmpd-haskell
        $ cd libmpd-haskell
        $ cabal configure && cabal build && cabal install

    Then get mpdfs itself:

        $ git clone git://github.com/joachifm/mpdfs.git mpdfs
        $ cd mpdfs
        $ cabal configure && cabal build && cabal install

    This assumes you already have cabal-install, which is available
    at http://hackage.haskell.org or (possibly) from your OS vendor.

Example usage
    $ mkdir mpd
    $ mpdfs mpd
    $ cd mpd
    $ cat Stats/albums
    $ cd ..
    $ fusermount -u mpd

Status
    Currently only a small subset of the program's features have actually been
    implemented, and much of the code is very bad.

    Output control is fully implemented.
    Stats, status, and playlist handling is partially implemented.

File system layout
    /Music/          The music database, where each song is represented as a file
                     The length of the song is encoded in the file size, and metadata
                     is encoded in the file name.

                     Opening a song adds it to the playlist and starts playback.
                     Seeking the handle of the song will cause the player to seek
                     in the song.

                     Read-only

        Genres/      Songs organised by genre
        Artists/     Songs organised by artist
        Albums/      Songs organised by album

    /Playlists/      Playlists, one directory per playlist
                     Creating a directory creates a playlist with the same name
                     Moving files to/from a playlist directory manipulates the playlist with the same name
    /Current/        Contains the current playlist
                     Deleting this directory clears the current playlist

    /Outputs/        Output devices, one read-only file per device
                     Output device file name scheme: outputID:outputName
                     Each file contains either 1 (if enabled) or 0 (if disabled)
                     Writing 0 to a file disables the output, any non-zero value enables it

    /Stats/          Statistics, one file per stat
                     Read-only

    /State/          State, one file per state type
        playback     A writable file containing current playback state (one of: play, pause, stop)
                     Writing to this file changes the playback state

        volume       A writable file containing current volume (absolute value)
                     Writing to this file changes the volume

        crossfade    A writable file containing the crossfade value
                     Writing to this file changes the crossfade value.

   /control          A writable file that allows sending raw commands to the server
